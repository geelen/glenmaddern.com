window.NAMESPACE.Widgets = window.NAMESPACE.Widgets || {};

window.NAMESPACE.Widgets.FooBar = function() {

// No import needed, since it's global...

> JavaScript needs a **standard way to include other modules** and for those modules to live in discreet namespaces. There are easy ways to do namespaces, but thereâ€™s no standard programmatic way to load a module (once!). This is really important, because server side apps can include a lot of code and will likely mix and match parts that meet those standard interfaces.
