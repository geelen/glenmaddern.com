> JavaScript needs a **standard way to include other modules** and for those modules to live in discreet namespaces. There are easy ways to do namespaces, but thereâ€™s no standard programmatic way to load a module (once!). This is really important, because server side apps can include a lot of code and will likely mix and match parts that meet those standard interfaces.

> Server side JavaScript is very fragmented. A script that accesses files can't be used without modification on both rhino and v8. Spidermonkey and JavaScriptCore can't both load in additional modules in the same way. A JavaScript web framework is very much tied to its interpreter and is often **forced to create a bunch of APIs that Python, Ruby and Java programmers take for granted**.
