Hi there, if you or someone you know need a bit of help with a front-end project, I'm looking for short-term engagements that can fit alongside [Front End Center](https://frontend.center), my screencast series.

I'm best at helping teams establish a front-end architecture to capture the underlying visual and functional structure in the UI, making it possible to iterate on the design as the build continues and feedback is received. Or, to help refactor a UI codebase that's become bogged down in technical debt. I definitely prefer that the project has dedicated front-end developers and I'm simply there for a short spell (2 to 6 weeks) to set the project in a good direction, then as needed as the project develops. But, if need be, I'm open to offers to just go away and build something on an hourly rate.

As this sort of role is based heavily around communication, and unless you're based here in Melbourne, Australia that would be written, asynchronous communication, maybe the best example of that I can point to is [my Github comments](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=commenter%3Ageelen). I can also provide recommendations from previous clients on request.

As for technologies, I mainly use and recommend React, and have thorough knowledge of related libraries such as Redux, MobX, [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com) & [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) (I co-created those last two) as well as plenty of experience working with Angular, Mercury, Sass, SVG, Web Components, canvas animations, WebRTC, WebGL, Web Audio, etc. Prior to specialising in front-end I was a backend engineer, and so I'm perfectly comfortable working on things like Rails, Postgres & AWS as well.

If you'd like to get in touch, email [glen@glenmaddern.com](mailto:glen@glenmaddern.com) or send a DM to [@glenmaddern](https://twitter.com/glenmaddern).
